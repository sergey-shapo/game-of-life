          <p>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by British mathematician
            John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its
            initial
            state and does not require any further input. Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life exhibits complex and
            fascinating patterns.</p>
          <p>The Game of Life is played on a two-dimensional grid of square cells, where each cell can be in one of two
            states: alive (often represented by a filled cell) or dead (often represented by an empty cell). The game
            follows the following rules:</p>
          <p>Birth: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive in the next generation.
            <br>Survival: A live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
            <br> Death: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies due to underpopulation, or with more than
            three
            live neighbors dies due to overpopulation.
            <br>Stasis: A dead or alive cell with two live neighbors remains unchanged in the next generation.
          </p>
          <p>To simulate the game, the initial pattern is set up, and then the cells evolve over generations based on
            the
            rules. The patterns that emerge can vary widely, from simple static structures to moving, oscillating, and
            self-replicating patterns.</p>
          <p>The Game of Life has been of interest to mathematicians, computer scientists, and enthusiasts alike due to
            its
            emergence of intricate patterns and its connections to various mathematical concepts, such as cellular
            automata, fractals, and complexity theory.</p>
          <p>Since it is a zero-player game, one can only set up the initial configuration and then watch the evolution
            of the cells.
            Numerous software implementations and coding projects have been developed to visualize and study Life
            patterns over
            time.</p>
